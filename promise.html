/*    
    The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous 
    operation, and its resulting value.    
    
    ===== Syntax
    //new Promise( // executor // function(resolve, reject) { ... } );

    The executor normally initiates some asynchronous work, and then, 
    once that completes, either calls the resolve function to resolve the promise 
    or else rejects it if an error occurred.
    If an error is thrown in the executor function, 
    the promise is rejected. The return value of the executor is ignored.

    A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. 
    It allows you to associate/add handlers with an asynchronous action's 
    eventual success value or failure reason. 

    This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: 
    instead of immediately returning the final value, 
    the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value 
    at some point in the future.

    =====A Promise is in one of these states:

    pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
    fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
    rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

    =====Properties
    Promise.length
            Length property whose value is always 1 (number of constructor arguments).
    Promise.prototype
            Represents the prototype for the Promise constructor.

//Promise Constructor
var promise1 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 1000, 'foo');
});

console.log(promise1);
// expected output: [object Promise]

//Promise.all()
var promise1 = Promise.resolve(3);
var promise2 = 42;
var promise3 = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  setTimeout(resolve, 100, 'foo');
});

Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then(function(values) {
  console.log(values);
});
// expected output: Array [3, 42, "foo"]
